Ruby extension 'ktoblzcheck'
============================

Install instructions for Linux systems:
---------------------------------------

After uncompressing the archive cd to the newly created directory and execute
the following commands:

  $ ruby extconf.rb
  $ make

Optional:

  $ ruby test-ktoblzcheck.rb
  $ ruby test-ktoblzcheck-all.rb

Become root

  # make install

Type `make --help` for available build options, see documentation for
Ruby's mkmf dir_config for options to configure installation location for the 
extension library.


Common errors:
--------------

* ruby extconf.rb fails with 
  "Couldn't find header file..." or
  "Couldn't find link library..."

  => Make sure the ktoblzcheck library and header files are correctly installed.
  => Consult the file mkmf.log for details of build time checks
  => Hint: If you've build and installed the ktoblzcheck library from source, make sure
     the install locations of the library files are listed in /etc/ld.so.conf and you've run 
     `ldconfig`

* compile errors

  Nothing to mention here: the code compiles without warning on Linux 2.6.7,
  glibc-2.3.2, gcc version 3.3.4 (Debian 1:3.3.4-7) with ruby 1.8.2
  (2004-07-29) [i386-linux].
  

Dependencies:
-------------

- Ruby 1.8
- libktoblzcheck (obviously :)

The ktoblzcheck package can be downloaded from
http://ktoblzcheck.sourceforge.net/ as source distribution tar-ball or RPM.

Debian has a package named 'libktoblzcheck1-dev' available in testing and
unstable, simply apt-get install it.



Other platforms:
----------------

As I have no suitable non-Linux systems to mess around with, I have no idea
whether this Ruby extension compiles and/or runs correctly on other platforms.

I guess, there should be no problems on BSDish systems. While the C-code should
be quiet portable, I'm not sure if linking works correctly on Microsoft (R)
Windows (R).

Comments on problems with OSes other than Linux are always welcome.
